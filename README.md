# The Fast Marching Method
what is the fast marching method? 
what does it solve? 
why is it useful?
references for further reading

## Design
single header file
prefer robustness and correctness over speed.
numerical and visual testing

## Testing and Verification
![hello world](https://github.com/thinks/fast-marching-method/blob/master/test/img/unsigned_grad_mag_float.png?raw=true "grad mag")


## Future Work
* Higher order spatial gradients.
* Specialize Eikonal solver for 2d/3d.
